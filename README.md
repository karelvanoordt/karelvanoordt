 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @karelvanoordt

```ruby

    career = journalist;

    def lifeSwitch(new_career)
        career = new_career
    end
    
    lifeSwitch(programmer)

```

As you can see, I turned my life 180deg making a switch to Software Development. Which I am glad. So now my life looks like this:


```ruby
    while karel.is_alive do
        code
        coffee
        cycle
        read
        baseball
        f1
        sleep
    end
```

- I am a versatile professional, always looking to learn new things, tools, languages and technologies.
- Currently looking for an entry level job at tech industry, ready to break into it.
- Also looking to collaborate on open source projects. Any amazing idea will be received with a smile.
