- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @karelvanoordt

```javascript

    let career = journalist;

    function lifeSwitch() {
        let changeCareer = () => {
            career = developer;
        }
    }

```

As you can see, I turned my life 180deg making a switch to Software Development. Which I am glad. So now my life looks like this:


```javascript
    while (alive) {
        code;
        coffee;
        cycling;
        read;
        baseball;
        f1;
        sleep;
    }
```

- I am a versatile professional, always looking to learn new things, tools, languages and technologies.
- Currently looking for an entry level job at tech industry, ready to break into it.
- Also looking to collaborate on open source projects. Any amazing idea will be received with a smile.
